        <p> 0) Implement `validate_answer`: the django view (function) for answer validation and feedback.<br/>

                <h3>Understanding:</h3>

                A question's answer can be an expression or a multiple-choice answer. <br/>
                
                i) By expression we mean a float, an algebraic expression, or a vector (more on vectors later).
                When the instructor creates a question, he specifies the type.
                        if it's an expression, then he enters text which is going to be parsed by mathjs and stored in ExpressionAnswer variable.
                ExpressionAnswer is one of the models, which has forein key the Question to which it's supposed to be the answer. That has already been implemented for you.
                You may find the `issinstance` in-built python class helpful. <br/>
                ii) A multiple-choice question can have one or multiple answers. The answers of a multiple-choice questions can be gotten easily using 
                a Django query, because the `McqAnswers` are related to the `Question` model (check phobos: models.py for more understanding).<br/><br/>

                <strong>Now, </strong>
                The user's input is going to be characters, and each time he submits, a javascript fetch is going to be executed,
                because we ultimately do not want to reload the entire the page. `validate_answer` is supposed to process the fetch
                and return a JSON object with success attribute True if the user has gotten the correct answer, and False otherwise, along with
                a feedback message. `validate_answer` has not yet been implemented: that's where you come in!

                <h3>Specification: Blank, at least for now (Will give more details in case you have questions)</h3>
        </p>
<p><br/><br/>

        1) Design the template `phobos: create_course.html` to be nearly-identical to the one provided
by the designer. Django view `create_course` has already been implemented for you.
You just need to modify the css and possibly JS. <br/>
        <ul>
        <li> Should be nearly-identical to the template provided by the deisgner(Wilder)</li>
        <li>   When the user add's a cover image, the page should not reload, but display that
           cover image. The text description in that area should also change from "Add cover image"
           to "Change cover image"</li>
        <li> When the x-icon is clicked, the user should be redirected to `phobos:index.html`
            You may use window.href in JS, or embed the x-icon in a link tag with href={% url 'phobos:index.html'%}</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<p><br/><br/>
2) Create the necessary animations for the templates `astros: register.html` and `astros: login.html`<br/>
        <ul>
   <li> Both the left side and right side of both pages should originally be dimmed. </li>
        (perhaps use the opacity attribute in css)
    <li> Then when the user clicks/types on one side, its brightness should be restored(opacity:1),
        but the other side should be automatically in a dimmed state. MUST: the transition must be smooth, so 
        use an animation.</li>
    <li> When either `astros: register.html` or `astros: login.html` loads, there should originally appear to be
        nothing on the page. Then one block should rise up from the bottom and separate into two to display
        the left side and right side. i.e. the instructor login/register section and the student login/register section</li>
                </ul>
