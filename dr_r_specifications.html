A) Design the template `phobos: create_course.html` to be nearly-identical to the one provided
by the designer. Django view `create_course` has already been implemented for you.
You just need to modify the css and possibly JS.
        1) Should be nearly-identical to the template provided by the deisgner(Wilder)
        2) When the user add's a cover image, the page should not reload, but display that
           cover image. The text description in that area should also change from "Add cover image"
           to "Change cover image"
        3) When the x-icon is clicked, the user should be redirected to `phobos:index.html`
            You may use window.href in JS, or embed the x-icon in a link tag with href={% url 'phobos:index.html'%}


B) Create the necessary animations for the templates `astros: register.html` and `astros: login.html`
    1) Both the left side and right side of both pages should originally be dimmed. 
        (perhaps use the opacity attribute in css)
    2) Then when the user clicks/types on one side, its brightness should be restored(opacity:1),
        but the other side should be automatically in a dimmed state. MUST: the transition must be smooth, so 
        use an animation.
    3) When either `astros: register.html` or `astros: login.html` loads, there should originally appear to be
        nothing on the page. Then one block should rise up from the bottom and separate into two to display
        the left side and right side. i.e. the instructor login/register section and the student login/register section
